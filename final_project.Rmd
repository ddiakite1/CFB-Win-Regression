## About 
Growing up, football has always been a big part of my life. In an attempt to win games, teams 
use differing amounts of run and pass plays. Over time, you can see that running the ball and passing 
the ball have varying success rates year by year at each level of football. In this project I will study the trends in teams being more likely to run/pass the ball, and look to find which has had more success.

There are five major conferences in college football, often referred to as the 'Power 5'. These 
five conferences are as follows: the Southeastern Conference (SEC), the Big Ten Conference (B1G 10), 
the Big 12 Conference (BIG 12), the Pacific-12 Conference (PAC 12), and the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). From these five conferences come majority of the powerhouse teams in college football, as well as the most popular teams. Within each conference, teams play each other and a conference champion is 
determined by a conference championship game. As of 2014, there is a four team playoff system to 
determine the sole national champion. By exploring data from 2010 to present date in each of these 
power five conferences, I will be able to determine which play styles work best in each conference as 
well as on a countrywide scale, and I can draw comparisons and contrasts between conferences.

As for my data, I collected it from multiple different sports-reference.com subpages.
The datasests that I retrieved from sports-reference.com were downloaded as excel files, read using the readxl library within r.
